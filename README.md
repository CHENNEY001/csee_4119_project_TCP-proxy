# Project 1 CSEE4119

To get the newest version of starter code:

		git pull origin master
		
The project is broken up into two stages (plus the initial set up to get you ready for the stages):

• In the preliminary stage, I implemented a simple proxy that sequentially handles clients and passes messages back and forth between client and server without modifying the messages.

• In the final stage, you extended the proxy to implement the full functionality described above, with the proxy modifying HTTP requests to perform bitrate adaptation.
